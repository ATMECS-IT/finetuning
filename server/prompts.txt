A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of fever and a nonproductive cough for the past 2 weeks. During this period, he has also had fatigue, myalgia, and difficulty breathing. Five weeks ago, he underwent an aortic prosthetic valve replacement due to high-grade aortic stenosis. The patient has a history of hypertension, asthma, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A colonoscopy 2 years ago was normal. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He has never used illicit drugs. Current medications include aspirin, warfarin, lisinopril, metformin, inhaled albuterol, and a multivitamin. The patient appears lethargic. Temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 105/min, and blood pressure is 140/60 mm Hg. Rales are heard on auscultation of the lungs. A grade 2/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. A photograph of his right index finger is shown. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 13,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 mm/h. What is the most likely causal organism?
Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks’ gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?
